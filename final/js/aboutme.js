  description:
    "Hello, my name is Justin. I am a student from Seneca college currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis (CPA). My interest in programming peaked when I was exposed to watching videos of my favourite content creators changing code in game files to have an interesting and fun playthrough. I have played video games all my life and have hopes of creating my own game in the future- but I am well aware of the long journey ahead of me until I reach that goal. ",
